The usual use is "horizontal", at one time, multiple streams sending in one point. 
Not usually "vertical" or one stream sending in multiple times (long range)

1) Append Test (Sequential w.r.t time/streamid)
   Insert lots of data in sequence - Insert Time vs Database Size
   Query All of it - Query vs Database Size

   #When done inserting

   Query All of it - Control
   Query Parts of it - Query Time vs Query Size


Sample data pattern 
Streamid Time Value
0        0    10
1        0    12
2        0    4
0        1    32
1        1    13
2        1    9
etc.


2) Insertion Test (non-sequential w.r.t time/streamid)
    (sequential streamid, random time in range, random value in range)
                                        -Random Insert Time vs Database Size
   #when done inserting
   Query parts of it - Query Time vs Query Size

Sample data pattern
Streamid Time Value
3        1    4
2        0    3
4        3    78
3        2    5
3        3    84
4        5    32
etc.
