Setup:
Install HBase
http://opentsdb.net/setup-hbase.html 
Don't use sudo

One Hbase is setup, add its binaries to /usr/bin - you can symlink them using the provided script
sudo ./linkup


You may have to set $JAVA_HOME=/usr

Next build opentsdb - try to avoid sudo unless specifically told of a permission error
http://opentsdb.net/getting-started.html


once everything runs, you'll need to 
./tsdb mkmetric mysql.bytes_received mysql.bytes_sent
to make a metric

and then pass in data with 

something like 
cat >loadavg-collector.sh <<\EOF
#!/bin/bash
set -e
while true; do
  awk -v now=`date +%s` -v host=`hostname` \
  '{ print "put proc.loadavg.1m " now " " $1 " host=" host;
     print "put proc.loadavg.5m " now " " $2 " host=" host }' /proc/loadavg
  sleep 15
done | nc -w 30 host.name.of.tsd PORT
EOF
chmod +x loadavg-collector.sh
nohup ./loadavg-collector.sh &


cd to /usr/bin
do ln -s ~/opentsdb/src/create_table.sh create_table.sh
