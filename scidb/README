The following instructions are adapted from scidb documentation for ubuntu 12.04. 

Firstly, you'll also need to replace dependencies.json in the downloaded tar with the one
included in setupmods/ . The modded file is released under GPL like the rest of scidb.

Now do:

sudo apt-get install -y build-essential cmake libboost1.46-all-dev \
postgresql-8.4 libpqxx-3.1 libpqxx3-dev libprotobuf7 libprotobuf-dev \
protobuf-compiler doxygen flex bison libxerces-c-dev libxerces-c3.1 liblog4cxx10 \
liblog4cxx10-dev libcppunit-1.12-1 libcppunit-dev libbz2-dev \
postgresql-contrib-8.4 libconfig++8 libconfig++8-dev libconfig8-dev subversion \
libreadline6-dev libreadline6 python-paramiko python-crypto xsltproc \
libncurses5-dev swig

Other steps:
Manually disable postgres9.1
    Change the text in /etc/postgresql/9.1/main/start.conf to disabled
    Reboot

Confirm postgres 8.4 running and 9.1 NOT running
sudo /etc/init.d/postgresql status

Configure postgres user password as indicated in ReadingDB folder's README

Do the usual build after copying over modded dependencies.json file:
sudo cmake .
sudo make -j4
sudo make install

Once this is all done:
cd /opt/scidb/12.3/etc
sudo cp sample_config.ini config.ini
cd /opt/scidb/12.3/bin
sudo ./scidb-prepare-db.sh
user and pass is always postgres, everything else should be default

This script will give you a string that you might need to feed to scidb.py, but
first try:
sudo ./scidb.py initall SingleInstance
if this doesn't work do:
sudo ./scidb.py -c "STRING GIVEN BY prepare-db" initall SingleInstance
sudo ./scidb.py startall SingleInstance

SciDB should now be up and running
