Looks like SciDB isn't designed for usual tsdb usage.

These instructions are now here just for reference. 

The following instructions are adapted from scidb documentation for ubuntu 12.04. 

Firstly, you'll also need to replace dependencies.json in the downloaded tar with the one
included in setupmods/ . The modded file is released under GPL like the rest of scidb.

Now do:

sudo apt-get install -y build-essential cmake libboost1.46-all-dev \
postgresql-8.4 libpqxx-3.1 libpqxx3-dev libprotobuf7 libprotobuf-dev \
protobuf-compiler doxygen flex bison libxerces-c-dev libxerces-c3.1 liblog4cxx10 \
liblog4cxx10-dev libcppunit-1.12-1 libcppunit-dev libbz2-dev \
postgresql-contrib-8.4 libconfig++8 libconfig++8-dev libconfig8-dev subversion \
libreadline6-dev libreadline6 python-paramiko python-crypto xsltproc \
libncurses5-dev swig

Other steps:
Manually disable postgres9.1
    Change the text in /etc/postgresql/9.1/main/start.conf to disabled
    Reboot

Confirm postgres 8.4 running and 9.1 NOT running
sudo /etc/init.d/postgresql status

Configure postgres user password as indicated in ReadingDB folder's README

Do the usual build after copying over modded dependencies.json file:
sudo cmake .
sudo make -j4
sudo make install

Once this is all done:
cd /opt/scidb/12.3/etc
sudo cp sample_config.ini config.ini
cd /opt/scidb/12.3/bin
sudo ./scidb-prepare-db.sh
user and pass is always postgres, everything else should be default

This script will give you a string that you might need to feed to scidb.py, but
first try:
sudo ./scidb.py initall SingleInstance
if this doesn't work do:
sudo ./scidb.py -c "STRING GIVEN BY prepare-db" initall SingleInstance
sudo ./scidb.py startall SingleInstance

SciDB should now be up and running
